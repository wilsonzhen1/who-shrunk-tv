            With the rise of streaming platforms, especially Netflix, there’s been a noticeable shift toward shorter, more “bingeable” seasons. This trend came under sharp focus during the 2023 Writers Guild strike, where writers pointed out that fewer episodes per season meant less pay and fewer opportunities. But beyond the economics, we wanted to explore whether this “TV shrinkage” is real, and if so, what it tells us about broader cultural shifts in how we consume media.

        <p class="para">
            The three main players in this market are critics, networks, and viewers. Join us as we explore data from all three of these sources to investigate the mystery of the shrinking TV show. Ultimately, we hope you bear these points in mind as you reflect on your own feelings about the changes observed.

        <p class="para">With claims about the shrinking nature of American television shows abound, the question becomes
            whether many audience members’ perception of shrinking series is correct. And if correct, what kinds of
            shows might be subject to this shrinking?
        </p>
        <p class="para">Let’s start with the series that attain critical acclaim — the ones that win one of the two
            biggest prizes in American television: the Emmy Awards for best comedy series and best drama series.

        <p class="para">
            In fact, it seems that over time, Emmy critics have come out with a resounding message: “Quantity does not
            equal quality.” Since 2000, awards for
            <span style="color: #7B3F74; font-weight: 800;">Best Drama</span> and
            <span style="color: #FF5F1F; font-weight: 800;">Best Comedy</span> have been awarded to series that pump out
            fewer episodes per season.

        While Emmy-nominated shows provide a useful lens into what critics value, they represent just a sliver of what’s actually being produced. To understand whether “TV shrinkage” is a widespread industry phenomenon—and not just a quirk of prestige programming—we need to broaden our scope.
       </p>
       <p class="para">
        Let’s examine a cross-section of the U.S. television landscape from 2000 to 2024, focusing on six major networks: 
        <span style="color:#FF0000;"><strong>ABC</strong></span>, 
        <span style="color:#FF8C00;"><strong>CBS</strong></span>, 
        <span style="color:#1E3A8A;"><strong>HBO</strong></span>, 
        <span style="color:#0084B4;"><strong>NBC</strong></span>, 
        <span style="color:#E50914;"><strong>Netflix</strong></span>, and 
        <span style="color:#9B1B30;"><strong>Showtime</strong></span>. 
        These networks span both legacy broadcasters and streaming newcomers, and they also happen to be some of the most frequent producers of 
        <span style="color: #2A9D8F; font-weight: 800;">Emmy-nominated and Emmy-winning shows</span>. By looking at their output, we gain a clearer, more representative picture of how television production strategies have evolved across the broader industry.

       <p class="para">
        The charts below show the <span style="color: #2A9D8F; font-weight: 800;">average runtime</span> and <span style="color: #2A9D8F; font-weight: 800;">median number of episodes per season</span> for shows on each network. At first glance, it becomes clear that some networks—particularly streaming services—have moved away from traditional TV formats. Where 20+ episode seasons once dominated, 8–10 episode seasons now seem increasingly common.

            of 20–24)
            isn’t a fluke—it’s a calculated move. However, just because critics and producers have begun to follow
            this pattern doesn’t necessarily mean that consumers’ viewing habits have changed to match.

            Netflix <em>while they were ranked</em>, i.e. any viewership from times when the show wasn’t in the top 10
            is excluded.

    <section class="conclusion">

        <p class="para">
           After analyzing data from critics, networks, and consumers, it’s clear that television’s shortening seasons aren’t merely an artifact of budget cuts or executive whim—they’re in line with how we, the audience, actually watch.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Across networks and prestige awards alike, median episode counts have fallen from the traditional 20+-episode model into a tight 8–10-episode sweet spot. Our Netflix viewership data confirms why: mid-length seasons generate the strongest per-episode engagement, front-loading binges into single-week spikes while preserving enough narrative room to develop characters and story arcs. Mini-seasons under six episodes and sprawling runs beyond fifteen episodes alike see far lower interest over time.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            What does this tell us about viewer behavior?
        </p>
        <p class="para"><span style="color: #2A9D8F; font-weight: 800;">Quality over quantity:</span> Audiences are
            happiest when shows hit that 8–10-episode sweet
            spot—enough time to develop story and characters, but not so long that momentum sputters.
        </p>


        <p class="para"><span style="color: #2A9D8F; font-weight: 800;">Narrative momentum matters:</span> Mini-seasons
            under six episodes rarely capture deep
            engagement, while sprawling runs beyond 15 episodes see per-episode interest taper off.
        </p>


        <p class="para"><span style="color: #2A9D8F; font-weight: 800;">Binge-friendly pacing:</span> Viewers reward a
            tight, binge-worthy arc with higher
            watch-time per episode, signaling a preference for seasons that respect their time and keep them hooked
            from start to finish.

        <p class="para">
            Ultimately, it seems the crime of “TV-shrinkage” isn’t committed solely by picky critics or cost-cutting networks— it also depends on the <em>viewers</em>. 
            Every impulsive “Next Episode” tap, every weekend binge, sends an unspoken decree to creators: strip away excess, sharpen the drama, and deliver satisfaction instantly. 
            In that light, the true architect of shorter seasons may well be the restless audience itself, with our collective tastes shaping the length of the stories we consume.
